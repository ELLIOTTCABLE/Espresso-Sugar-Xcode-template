Espresso Sugar Xcode Template
-----------------------------
This is a simple Xcode template for starting an [Espresso][] Sugar (that is, a
plug-in).

Installing it is easy enough. You need [git][] installed (though you can
download a tarball/zipfile from [GitHub][], I won't cover that here), and simply
execute the following:
    
    git clone git://github.com/elliottcable/Espresso-Sugar-Xcode-template.git \
      "/Developer/Library/Xcode/Project Templates/Application Plug-in/Espresso Sugar"
    
After re-launching Xcode, you should see an "Espresso Sugar" in the templates.
